Flight Price Prediction
Project Overview
This project aims to predict flight prices based on various factors such as departure and arrival cities, flight duration, airline, and other relevant features. The prediction model leverages machine learning techniques to help users make informed decisions about when and where to book their flights.

Features
Predicts the price of flights based on input features such as departure/arrival locations, airlines, and date of travel.
Allows for data preprocessing, feature engineering, and evaluation of model performance.
Implements various machine learning algorithms to compare the effectiveness in predicting flight prices.

Technologies Used
Python: Programming language for implementing the prediction model.
Scikit-learn: For training and evaluating machine learning models.
Pandas: For data manipulation and preprocessing.
NumPy: For numerical operations and handling data arrays.
Matplotlib/Seaborn: For data visualization and exploring trends in flight prices.
Jupyter Notebook: For developing and documenting the machine learning workflow.

Installation Prerequisites
Make sure you have Python installed (preferably Python 3.7 or higher). You will also need the following libraries:
pandas
numpy
scikit-learn
matplotlib
seaborn

Steps to Install
Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/Barghav777/flight-price-prediction.git
cd flight-price-prediction

Run the Jupyter notebook or Python scripts to train the model and make predictions.

How to Use
Data Input: The project accepts flight data (e.g., departure/arrival locations, flight dates) to predict flight prices. The data can be input manually or from a dataset (CSV/Excel).
Model Training: The project contains code to preprocess the dataset, train a machine learning model, and evaluate its accuracy using metrics like RMSE, R-squared, etc.
Prediction: Once trained, the model can predict flight prices for new inputs. You can either use a simple command line interface or a web interface if implemented.
Results: The output of the model includes the predicted price and a performance evaluation report to help understand the model's effectiveness.
