# Flight Price Prediction

## Project Overview
This project predicts the price of flights based on various features such as departure/arrival cities, flight duration, airline, and other factors. The model uses machine learning techniques to help users make informed decisions about when and where to book flights. The project includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, and comparison of different machine learning models to evaluate the best performance.

## Features
- Predicts flight prices based on input features such as departure and arrival locations, flight duration, airline, and travel date.
- Implements multiple machine learning models (e.g., Random Forest, Linear Regression) and compares their performance.
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering steps for cleaning and preparing the data for model training.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Programming language for data analysis and machine learning.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and cleaning.
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations.
- **Scikit-learn**: For machine learning algorithms and model evaluation.
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn**: For data visualization.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For creating and running the code in an interactive environment.
